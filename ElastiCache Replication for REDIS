								ElastiCache Replication for REDIS



				1. ElastiCache Replication: Cluster mode Disable

				- There is 1 Primary CACHE original Node
				- we can set upto 5 Cache Replica nodes.
				- If Primary Cache node is failed, automatically It will replaced by Replica Nodes.
				
				- Primaary node - Write Ops.
				- Other node - Read Ops.
				
				- Multi-AZ enabled bydefault for failover.
				
				
			- REDIS SCALING
			
			- Horizontal Scaling - By adding/remve read replicas max. 5 replicas.
			
			- Vertical Scaling - By Changing Node type smaller to larger. Like Change Instance type.
			
			
			
				2. ElastiCache Replication: Cluster Mode Enabled
				
				- Data is partitioned/divided. - It Helps to scale writes.
				- Each Partitions has a PRIMARY NODE AND UPTO 5 REPLICA NODES.
				- Multi-AZ Capability.
				
				
				- Auto-Scaling Supported.
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
		- Redis Metrics to Monitor
		 
		1. Evictions: No. of non-expired items the cache evicted to allow fpace for new writes.
		
		Solutions - Choose an eviction policy to evict expired items.
                          - Scale up to larger node type for more memory or scale out by adding more nodes.
                          
                2. CPUUtilization: Solutions - Scale upt o larger node type or scale out by adding more nodes.
                
                3. CurrConnections: No. of concurrent and active connections.
                
                4. DatabaseMemoryUsagePercentage: Thepercentage of memory utiliztions
