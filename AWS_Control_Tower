								AWS Control Tower
								
		We learnt about aws organization service.
		we can manage lot of account in single account for single billing ( Consolidate billing )and applying iam policies to     	accounts and users ( Service control Policy).
		
		This is manage by ROOT USER ( AWS Organization's Account ).
		but, it can not manage lot of account and user at once time.
		he have to manage 1 by 1 account. means, Create new aws account for new user.
						   	   Add this user to Particular group.
						   	   give IAM Permission.
						   	   if user will retire, then his iam account will not required longer.
						   	   Remove his account.
						   	   
					This all things are can not manage by ROOT USER.
					We can managed it like lifecycle policeis in s3.
					we can scheduled for all above things by AWS Control Tower.
					
					Means, Je vastu AWS Organization manage kara chhe tene automatic manage kara chhe CONTROL TOWER.
