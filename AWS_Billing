								AWS Billing
								
	I'm using ec2, s3, cloudfront, eventbrige, vpc, cloudformation etc.
	Want to bill for ec2 and s3. means specific aws services only.
	I will set Threshold for that.
	I can receive email, massages notification alarm by AWS Billing.
	
	
	
								AWS Budgets  1. cost data,  2. Usage  3. Saving plan  4. Reservation Budget.
								
	I want to bill for overall aws services which i am using in my account. 
	I will set Threshold and i will receive notifications alert by AWS Budgets. 
	
				1. Cost data - Set Budget > Attach IAM Policy of AWSBUDGET > set ACTION during cross Budget.
							     so, if iam user is cross budget you set then ACTION Will play.
							     Like, you set action as ec2 will stop if budget 10 will cross by iam user.
							     or IAM User can not launch more EC2.
