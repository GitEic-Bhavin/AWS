Types of Alarm States:

1. OK - That is not triggered.
2. INSUFFICIENT_DATA - There is not enough data for tha alarm to  determine a state.
3. ALARM - Your threshold has been breached. therefor notification will be sent.

PERIOD:

 ALARM HAS 3 MAIN TARGETS. 1. Action on instances like stop, terminate, reboot etc.
