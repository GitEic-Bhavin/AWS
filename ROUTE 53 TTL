								ROUTE 53 TTL

I made a request to google.com from my web browser.
It will go to local dns server. 
if local dns server does not cache , it will send to Authorized DNS Server where all records are being kept.

you set a TTL 300s.

agian you made a request, you have not to go to Authorized server, directly fatch to your web server.

				NOW, TTL is COME HERE, YOU SET TTL 300s, means what ?
				
				again you make a request - if dns server ip or domain name is modified or replace to another EC2.
							  - Still you ara able to log in , retrive data from that dns server.
							  - WHY ?
							  - Because, you have min. 300 second ( TTL )
							  - for only 300 second , you can retrive , log in into that server.



Low TTL , 60 sec > More Request / traffic on your route 53 server > more money you have to spend.
High TTL, 200 sec > Low Request / traffic on your route 53 server > low money you have to spend.
