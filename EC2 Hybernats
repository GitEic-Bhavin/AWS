Lets, know about ec2 stop, start, terminates

STOP- your ec2s data are stored into EBS volume.
when you stop & start ec2, your data still available in EBS volume. 
Bcz, EBS volume is attached over Network.

But, when you terminates ec2, your all data in EBS will be not recoverable. It's Destroyed.

TO RECOVER THIS PROBLEM , HERE, EC2 HYBERNATS WILL WORK.

WHAT'S EC2 HYBERNATS ?

When you go to action- stop- terminates options, there are not option of hybernates.

You have to enable it.

aftet that, select ec2 hybernates.

in the hybernates,

when you stop ec2, whatever last process was run, that process was RESUMED not restart that process agin.

tamari je process run thai hase, te process resume thai jase, jyare tame hybernates karo tyare.
pachi tame start karo ec2 ne, tyare simple tamari process last run hati te RESUMED mathi j chalu thai jase.

ex, simply tame ec2 ne stop-start karo to tema ec2 status check ma initializing, then, 
2/1 process pass, 2/2 process pass, OS REBOOT , & it take too much time.

THIS THING IS NOT HAPPENS IN EC2 HYBERNATES.

HYBERNATES, NOT REBOOT OS.

THIS TIME WILL SAVE.

YOUR RESUMED PROCESS( copying files, crontabs live data.. ) ETC WILL BE START FROM RUSEUMED.

IT'S ONLY OVERVIEW.



                                      WHATS ABOUT CONCEPT?

ON EC2 HYBERNATES
STOP EC2

EC2 IS STOPPING...

EC2 IS STOPPED..

NOW, EBS MEMORY OF EC2 WILL BE SAVED IN ANOTHER RAM BY THIS HYBERNATS.

YOUR RUNNIG PROCESS CAN NOT BE LOSS.

WHEN YOU START EC2 , THEN THIS RAM WILL BE AVAILABLE IN EBS VOLUME.

SO, YOUR RESUMED PROCESS WILL START FROM RESUMED.
IT'S NOT REQUIRED LIKE - OS REBOOT, status check - initialization, then system/hardware 2/2 process check passed and then  your ec2 will running well.

it's all not required. this time will save.

your process start from resume.

NOTE:- IF YOU DO NOT USE HYBERNATES, AND YOUR PROCESS IS RUNNING..
       YOU RESTART EC2- YOUR RUNNING PROCESS WILL NOT BE THERE.

       YOU HAVE TO START THAT PROCESS AGAIN.

       That's It!

       to use hybernates, encrypts EBS Volume first.
